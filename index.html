  <b>UNIT I</b><br>
<em>THE BASICS OF THE WEB</em> 

<p><b> - The Web <br>
  - HTML <br>
  - URLS <br>
  - HTTP <br>
  - Web Applications </b></p> 

<p><b><em>World Wide Web</b></em> - Collection of HTML Documents.<br>
(Web invented in 1990s.  Has about 30 billion pages).</p> 

<p>The<b>Major Pieces/Concepts</b> of the web are best illustrated by this picture:<br> <img src=http://tuxar.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Client-server-model.png </p>

<p><em><b> WEBPAGE SUMMARY:</b></em><br>
- A webpage is a text document written in a language called HTML.  Browsers read these documents and then<br> interpret & display them.</p>
<p><b> <em>HTML </b> </em> - <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. <br>
 - HTML Documents make up the web. Considered the "heart" of the web. </p>

 <em>HTML is made up of the following:</em> <br> 

 <p>1) <b>Text Content</b> - What you see. <br>
 2) <b> Markup</b> - What it looks like. <br>
 3) <b> Reference to other Docs</b> - e.g. Images & Videos. <br>
 4) <b> Links to other Pages</b> </p>

 <p><b>HTML Markup:</b><br>
  < Name > Contents < /Name > ------ <em>**This is known as an <b> ELEMENT</b>**</em> (everything within a set of opening <br> and closing tags). <br> 
  ** < Name > = <b> OPENING TAG</b> <br> 
  **< /Name > = <b>CLOSING TAG </b></em> </p>

  <p> <b>Tags</b> are part of basic HTML vocabulary. An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. <br> Most Tags have an <em>Open Tag</em> and <em> Closing Tag.</em>  Some examples are: </p>
  <p> <b> B Tag</b> - < b > <b>contents</b> < /b > <br>  
  b = <b>BOLD</b> (the contents will always appear in bold).</p>
  <p><b> Em Tag</b> - < em > <em>contents</em> < /em > <br>
  em = <em>EMPHASIS</em> (the content will always appear in italics).</p>

  <p>Some Tags do not require a closing tag. These are called <b>Void Tags</b>. Examples are: </p>
  <b>< img ></b> = Image Tag <br>
  <b> < br ></b> = Break Tag </p>

  <p></p><b>HTML ATTRIBUTES</b> - <em> A Property of an HTML Element</em>.</p>
  <p>- An HTML Attribute looks like the following:<br>
  <b> < Tag Attr = "Value" > Contents < /Tag></b></p>
  <p>An example of a Tag that uses an Attribute is the <b>Anchor Tag</b>. <br>
  <b>Anchor Tag - < a ></b> <br>
  - Anchors are for making links.</p>
 <p><em>FULL EXAMPLE:</em>  < a href = www.reddit.com > derp < /a > <br>
 <em>**href = Attribute Name <br>
   **www.reddit = Value (In This Case a URL) <br>
   **derp = contents </em></p>
 <p><b>IMAGE TAG</b> ( < img >) <br>
   < img src = "url" alt = "text" > <br>
   <em>** alt = text is <b>required</b> (text gets displayed when image does not load).</em></p>
<p><b>WHITE SPACE:</b> Text entered on multiple lines are all entered into a single space. To force it to have multiple<br>
lines, we use the tag <b> < br ></b> <em>(Break Tag).</em></p>
<p>*EXAMPLE  WITHOUT THE  < br > tag: <br><br>
" Text On Multiple Lines" <br><br>
*EXAMPLE WITH THE < br > tag: <br><br>
"Text On <br>
Multiple Lines</p>
<p>- Another way of using line breaks is to use the tag <b> < p ></b> <br>
  <b> < p ></b> stands for paragraph and looks like this: <br>
  <b> < p > content < /p ></b></p>
  <p><b>INLINE / BLOCK</b> <br><br>
    Why do we have two ways for making new lines?<br><br>
    <em>ANSWER:</em> <br><br>
    <b> < br ></b> = Inline -- Says where to end the line and have the remaining text wrap to the next line <br>
    <b> < p ></b> = Block -- Makes invisable box around text that can have height and width</p>
<p> <b>SPAN & DIV ELEMENTS</b> <br>
  < Span > text < / Span > - <em>Inline</em><br>
  < Div > text < /Div > - <em>Block</em> <br><br>
  - You can attach different styles to them to adjust behaviors of how they display.</p> 
  <p><b><em>OTHER IMPORTANT NOTES TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS LESSON:</em></b><br><br>
  <b> * How Coding Works</b> - Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can<br> 
  understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. <br><br>
  <b>* Computers Are Stupid</b> - Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known <br>
  as writing with the correct "Syntax").  For example, if you forget to close a < b > tag, the computer wont be <br>
  able to figure out what you had intended to make bold.  This "Stupidicity" can be very frustrating, but it also <br>
  gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything <br>
  you want. <br><br>
  <b>*Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b> - There are too many details to keep everything in your head. If <br>
  you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.</p>
